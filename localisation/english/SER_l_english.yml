 ###Events
 ww1_serbia.1.t:0 "Grand Coalition Collapsed"
 ww1_serbia.1.d:0 "Not even a month after the crisis has started, all ministers except the prime minister and foreign minister have resigned. As the coalition's life duration was already extended past all due points, it was only a matter of time for this experiment to fail, especially considering the calming of the region. While independent radicals expect new elections as it should've happened in 1908, the radical party has a relatively comfortable majority in parliament and can form a homogenous government. As the king refused to give the mandate to Pašić again, a homogenous government will be formed by Milovan Milovanović, the former foreign minister that will be merging his role with prime minister one for the duration of his mandate..."

 ww1_serbia.2.d:0 "Elections are being held today. Most of the lists run separate although in some places there is formed some kind of anti-radical coalition consisting of National and Progressive parties. Elections are being held in the relatively new circumstances considering our new relations with Bulgaria and inevitable war that will the winner government wage against Ottoman Empire. As of now there is 5 lists, 2 radical lists that as always take the most votes, old Obrenović's parties and the new Socialdemocratic party that will for the first time open electoral posts in villages as well.

 ww1_serbia.3.d:0 "Seeing our switch in foreign policy, small group of 5 deputies from People's Radical Party stated together that they can not and will not tolerate the new switch in foreign policy. Therefore they stopped supporting the government and were thus kicked out of the party. But with them leaving Radical Party is left in very dangerous situation, as they are one deputy short of majority, having 79 deputies in support of the government out of 160 deputies in parliament total. We can expect motion of no confidence at any point from now on and only our prime minister's actions in placating the opposition parties can prolong the government's mandate in this situation of lost majority, and with alliance with Bulgaria in formation, government crash is the last thing we need."

 ww1_serbia.4.t:0 "Government Crisis!"
 ww1_serbia.4.d:0 "Independent Radicals had long restrained from calling off the confidence vote, mainly because of uncertain political situation in the region and the formation of alliance with Bulgaria. But as of now, alliance with Bulgaria had only became matter of time and situation in region has started to stabilize, they decided that now is the best time to call off the motion, especially since parliament's mandate would've been ending relatively soon. As People's Radical government was already in minority, government had no way for surviving the motion and therefore resigned as whole. We must now choose new government and king Peter was fast enough to suggest..."

We have options to pressure him to form the temporary government without the minister or to just form radical government again and hope they establish majority. Though it isn't that far fetched that government forms majority, perhaps it isn't best solution considering that mandate of this assembly would've ended anyhow relatively soon for regular elections to happen in May or June. Perhaps the best option would be to be in technical mandate and hold elections in a month or so..."

Since we had to start rapproachment with radical dissidents who betrayed us few months ago, a lot of the radical party didn't like the move, including the current prime minister that took the position after dr Milovanović passed away. Therefore he resigned from the position and the government mandate will be given to the leader of People's Radical party, Nikola Pašić."

 ww1_serbia.9.t:0 "Dr Milovan Đ. Milovanović dies"
 ww1_serbia.9.d:0 "Prime Minister dr Milovan Đ. Milovanović has passed away today in his 49th year. He was the single biggest contributor to the alliance with Bulgaria that got expanded into now known as Balkan League. His deeds will never get forgotten. He dedicated his last years shaping foreign policy of Radical governments. He was the foreign minister in most of the recent governments and his biggest life achievement he will never see come into fruition. As Nikola Pašić is in Russia right now and had already announced that he has no desire to take over government right now, Milija will be replaced by his interior minister Marko Trifković who vowed to uphold his legacy and make his project to it's fullest potential by liberating the Balkans, either he or his successor.

Allegedly, most of the party got dissatisfied by it's leader, his party considers his refusal to take mandate as huge blow to his party and Supreme council voted for his removal as both the head and member of the party. He will be replaced by the former mayor of Belgrade Ljubomir Davidović who has mostly more moderate ideas than his staunchly republican predcessor."

 ww1_serbia.11.t:0 "Coalition Crisis!"
 ww1_serbia.11.d:0 "Our fragile coalition made up of both radical parties, biggest parties in Serbia by now is already showing some cracks. Namely, after smaller scandal in Ministry of Public Economy, Stojan Protić and his counterpart minister from coalition, Jaša Prodanović, the two people that kept coalition together, have resigned. We expect that most of the government will follow suite in the next weeks. As radicals still have comfortable majority, they are able to form homogenous government, pushing their coalition partners back into opposition. Only time will tell, as this instabillity might provoke our enormous northern and western neighbour into action."

 ww1_serbia.12.d:0 "Elections were held few days ago. After recounting the votes the winner is People's Radical party of Nikola Pašić. As expected mandate will be given to the former prime minister Milovanović as extension of his previous mandate. His alliance with Bulgaria, successful previous Radical mandates and all of the promises from heated electoral campaign contributed greatly to the success of Radicals. Milovanović has in public address after victory ensured that he will do everything in his power to see his biggest creation come into fruition by liberating all of the Balkans against 5 centuries of Turkish rule. Government will face new odds and first one of them would be the status in the parliament since they are just 1 deputy above majority and Radicals will need to ensure bigger support"

 ww1_serbia.13.d:0 "Elections were held few days ago. After recounting the votes the winner is Independent Radical party of Ljubomir Stojanović. After consultations with king Peter I, mandate will be given to the party leader. The failures of the previous government, the disappointment regarding alliance with Bulgaria and of Annexation Crisis where Radical government lost Bosnia for the foreseable future contributed greatly to the Radical party's fail in these elections. As expected Stojanović has already expressed the need to deal with eastern neighbour and to fix the multiple problems that plagued recent Radical governments. Though even general direction of his mandate is unsure, his disapproval of monarchy as a system could play a great influence on the future of Independent Radical party and Serbia in whole."

 ww1_serbia.14.d:0 "It became clear to everyone even before last government fell that this current parliamentary disposition is not legitimate, nor allows any party to form majority on it's own. [FROM.GetLeader] had tried everything in his power to form stable majority but everyone's opinion is the same, it's time for new elections. Therefore, [FROM.GetLeader] has requested from king Peter I to dissolve current assembly and declare new elections as soon as possible. After much consideration king Peter I accepted our request, has dissolved the assembly and officially started electoral campaign."

In an overwhelming motion of no confidence, where even Radical Party voted for his removal from office, minister Milovanović had lost the position. He will be replaced with more hardliner radical party member, Stojan Protić who will merge his roles of finance minister and prime minister for the duration of his mandate. However, this motion today showed just how fragile the Radical Party's rule is, and we can probably expect the fall of the new government soon..."

 ww1_serbia.16.t:0 "Bloody Parliament Session"
 ww1_serbia.16.d:0 "Even though our parliamentary discussions often become heated to the point that threats are made, they mostly stayed at that level. Today, the situation was different. Namely, a deputy from the People's Radical Party, Nikola Uzunović, brought a gun inside parliament. During a heated discussion in the parliament, once he was about to speak, while a opposition deputy was finishing his speech and he was waiting for his turn, he brought out a gun, shot at the deputy who was finishing his speech and then shot in the direction of the opposition benches in parliament. \nThe epilogue of the event is few of the Independent Radical deputies were heavily wounded and the speaker was killed on the spot. The deputy disappeared from the parliament but tomorrow he surrendered to the minister of the police, Stojan Protić. \nThe opposition left the parliament and will not return for the foreseable future, increasing the crisis with obstruction of the parliament. While they are waiting for the recovery of their members and mourn up their lost members, the motives of the attack are unknown as the deputy Uzunović refuses to speak. However, a lot of people blame the increasing political tensions in the government, along with the recent purges of the military and the increase of the power of the regent as his father decided to retire from throne."

 ww1_serbia.17.t:0 "Regent replaces the Prime Minister!"
 ww1_serbia.17.d:0 "The news of the attack came to the regent, who quickly summoned the prime minister. In a heated discussion, the regent blamed the government for instigating this event and cited that it was their responsibility to control the events inside the parliament to not come to bloody resolutions. The regent had, with allegedly heavy heart, dismissed the entire government with the prime minister Pašić in tow, and as interim government posted a known radical, Stojan Protić, hoping that the political crisis would cool down with time and with Pašić out of the picture."

 ww1_serbia.18.d:0 "Former prime minister for a long time and a political veteran, mr Nikola Pašić had not even day after the heated discussion with the regent, died of a heart stroke. He was the leader of the Radical Party for quite a long time, ever since it's creation till this day, survived a lot of pressure under Obrenović dynasty and then he thought he finally found peace with Karađorđević dynasty. The state funeral was organized for him, to which present were his wife, his son, king Petar I and his sons, regent and prince, entire government, half of the radical party and a lot of foreign representatives from Entente and Central Powers alike.
